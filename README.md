# LIDAR_PROC

The code will be released soon.

## Introduction

This project proposes a real-time semantic segmentation method using LiDAR sensors. The method combines SalsaNext with semantic forecasting to enhance the object recognition capabilities of autonomous vehicles.

## Features

- Real-time LiDAR semantic segmentation
- Low latency
- High accuracy
- Evaluation based on the Semantic-KITTI dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
